Hello I am creating yet another website! 

I'm ditching the paid hosting for github pages and retiring a made from scratch site for a responsive theme generated with Pelican static site generator.

I'm starting grad school tomorrow. Literally tomorrow in less than 2hrs it starts. Dun dun dunnnnn. 

I graduated approx 2yrs ago in June and now I'm ready to go back for more! I truly love learning and I love the structure I have to bring back into my life. 

Currently I am an organizer for a Python User's Group here in Omaha. I am a co-organizer for TechOmaha. I have started to do web maintenance, consolation, and social media freelancing on the side. I am also a Software Engineer who specializes in automating internal repetitive tasks working on a Cloud Services &Engineering team.
